# hello-world
Hello future self.

You are learning how to code. Currently you are on challenge 21 of Learn Python the Hard way. At this moment, you have no idea how to code really. You just got back from the snowboard trip 2020, and havnt coded for 5 days. Getting back into it is hard, but you picked up your book anyways to do what you love. I hope reading this in the future gives you a reminder that you didnt give up. Its almost been a month of coding.
